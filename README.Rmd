**Harbinger** is a framework for event detection in time series. It provides an integrated environment for anomaly detection, change point detection, and motif discovery. Harbinger offers a broad range of methods and functions for plotting and evaluating detected events.

For anomaly detection, methods are based on:
- Machine learning model deviation: Conv1D, ELM, MLP, LSTM, Random Regression Forest, and SVM
- Classification models: Decision Tree, KNN, MLP, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM
- Clustering: k-means and DTW
- Statistical techniques: ARIMA, FBIAD, GARCH

For change point detection, Harbinger includes:
- Linear regression, ARIMA, ETS, and GARCH-based approaches
- Classic methods such as AMOC, ChowTest, Binary Segmentation (BinSeg), GFT, and PELT

For motif discovery, it provides:
- Methods based on Hashing and Matrix Profile

Harbinger also supports **multivariate time series analysis** and **event evaluation** using both traditional and soft computing metrics.

The architecture of Harbinger is based on **Experiment Lines** and is built on top of the [DAL Toolbox](https://github.com/cefet-rj-dal/daltoolbox). This design makes it easy to extend and integrate new methods into the framework.
