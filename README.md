**Harbinger** is a framework for event detection in time series. It
provides an integrated environment for anomaly detection, change point
detection, and motif discovery. Harbinger offers a broad range of
methods and functions for plotting and evaluating detected events.

For anomaly detection, methods are based on: - Machine learning model
deviation: Conv1D, ELM, MLP, LSTM, Random Regression Forest, and SVM -
Classification models: Decision Tree, KNN, MLP, Naive Bayes, Random
Forest, and SVM - Clustering: k-means and DTW - Statistical techniques:
ARIMA, FBIAD, GARCH

For change point detection, Harbinger includes: - Linear regression,
ARIMA, ETS, and GARCH-based approaches - Classic methods such as AMOC,
ChowTest, Binary Segmentation (BinSeg), GFT, and PELT

For motif discovery, it provides: - Methods based on Hashing and Matrix
Profile

Harbinger also supports **multivariate time series analysis** and
**event evaluation** using both traditional and soft computing metrics.

The architecture of Harbinger is based on **Experiment Lines** and is
built on top of the [DAL
Toolbox](https://github.com/cefet-rj-dal/daltoolbox). This design makes
it easy to extend and integrate new methods into the framework.
