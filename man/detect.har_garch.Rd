\title{Performs anomaly event detection in the time series using the GARCH model}
\usage{
\method{detect}{har_garch}(obj, serie)
}
\arguments{
\item{serie}{}
}
\value{
A data frame with information about the events detected, including the index of the data point, whether it is an event or not, and the type of event
}
\description{
This function takes a har_garch object and a time series series as input
}
\details{
First, the function fits a GARCH model to the series, calculates the squared residuals and applies a boxplot test to detect outliers. Detected outliers are classified as "anomalies"
}
