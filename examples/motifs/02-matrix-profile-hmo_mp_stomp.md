## Objective

This notebook demonstrates motif discovery using Matrix Profile with the STOMP algorithm via `hmo_mp("stomp", ...)`. It identifies repeated subsequences (motifs) efficiently in long series. Steps: load packages/data, visualize, configure subsequence length and number of motifs, fit, detect, evaluate, and plot.

## Method at a glance

STOMP motif discovery: Matrix Profile methods compute, for each subsequence, the distance to its nearest neighbor subsequence. STOMP is an efficient exact algorithm for long series. Harbinger provides Matrix Profile via `tsmp` and wraps it in `hmo_mp()`.

## What you will do

- understand the purpose of the example and when the technique is useful
- follow the workflow from data loading to model fitting and detection
- inspect the evaluation outputs and the diagnostic plots produced by Harbinger

## How to read this walkthrough

The code blocks below follow the same learning rhythm used throughout the collection: prepare the environment, choose the dataset, configure the method, run the analysis, and then inspect the result. Readers who are still learning time-series mining can use that order to understand not only *what* each command does, but also *why* it appears at that stage of the workflow.

As you go through the notebook, read the inline comments inside each chunk as the operational explanation and use the surrounding prose as the conceptual guide.

data(examples_motifs)
```


``` r
# Select a simple example time series
dataset <- examples_motifs$simple
head(dataset)
```

# Fit the model
  model <- fit(model, dataset$serie)
```


``` r
# Detect motifs
  detection <- detect(model, dataset$serie)
