# Harbinger Examples

Index of example R Markdown notebooks organized by topic. Each subdirectory README links to individual `.md` tutorials.

## Directories

- [anomalies](anomalies/README.md) — Anomaly detection across multiple families: regression residuals (ARIMA, GARCH, FFT, wavelet), clustering/discord (DTW, k-means), supervised ML classifiers, and deep-learning autoencoders. Includes ensemble strategies and thresholding utilities.
- [change_point](change_point/README.md) — Change-point detection techniques: AMOC, Binary Segmentation, PELT, structural break tests (Chow, GFT), and ChangeFinder variants based on ARIMA/ETS/LR/GARCH.
- [motifs](motifs/README.md) — Motif and discord discovery via Matrix Profile (STAMP, STOMP, SCRIMP, PMP, VALMOD) and symbolic methods (SAX, XSAX).
- [general](general/README.md) — High-level tours, utilities, and evaluation (hard and soft), plus overview notebooks for anomalies, change points, and motifs.
